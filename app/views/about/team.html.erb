<h5>Future Co-founder. Shares similar ideas about the vision, size
  and what it will take to get it done. Should have different
  expertise, orientation and perspective. If you already knew who
  I was and you saw me in a shopping mall, your initial reaction
  would be to come over and say hello instead of running away or hiding.
